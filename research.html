      <ul>
        <li>Spine Enhanced Climbing Autonomous Legged Exploration Robot (SCALER)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Y. Tanaka et al., "Scaler: A tough versatile quadruped free-climber robot," in Proc. IEEE/RSJ Intl. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS, (Kyoto, Japan), Oct. 2022 </li>
          <ul>
              <li>Improved hardware reliability by remaking wires and redoing the leg wire management</li>
              <li>Modified the purchased linear actuators by attaching cooling fans to prevent overheating damage</li>
              <li>Integrated an STM32 onboard the grippers to make them controllable via serial connection and redid the wiring so that the gripper is a standalone module connected by a single power line and 12 pin communication line</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Y. Shirai et al., "Simultaneous Contact-Rich Grasping and Locomotion via Distributed Optimization Enabling Free-Climbing for Multi-Limbed Robots", in Proc. IEEE/RSJ Intl. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS, (Kyoto, Japan), Oct. 2022 </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Rewrote a pre-existing MATLAB visualization code for SCALAR to improve usability and future expandability by modularizing each component (main chassis, limbs, grippers, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Garama RC Racing Platform</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Wrote a camera orientation estimation script that would take in a series of the car's first person view and figures out how the car moves within 3D space based on features found using the ORB algorithm</li>
          <li>Reworked the wiring onboard by optimizing the wire lengths and fixed the soldering job done by the PhD student to improve reliability</li>
          <li>Collected driving data used to train the behavior cloning neural network</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3> Dunn Lab </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked with Prof. Bruce Dunn in the MSE department to develop a BLE enabled optoprobe device that is hooked up to a living mouse to send a two-channel optical stimulation to different parts of its brain via optical fibers</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Wrote a C++ script alongside another undergraduate student for the BMD-350 chip to communicate with an evaluation board hooked up with the computer</li>
            <li>Designed a custom GUI within MATLAB to send the appropriate serial commands to the evaluation board which transmitted a sequence of bits that determined what frequency the two LEDs flashed at</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

      <h3> Interconnected & Integrated Bioelectronics Lab (I<sup>2</sup>BL) </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Worked for Prof. Sam Emaminejad to develop a near IR spectroscopy system for lower leg tissue oxygenation monitoring</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Looked into various transimpedance amplifier designs that improved the old design by achieving higher output precision with good noise performance, all with minimum power consumption</li>
          <li>Redesigned the circuit schematic and rerouted the PCB to make it more compact (approx. 40% board area reduction)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
